# Explore the Cosmos

A final take-home challenge from Turing where we were given a spec and expected to complete the spec requirements on our own. Spec challenge was meant to imitate a code challenge from potential employers. Time given to complete project was two days.

[Project Spec](https://gist.github.com/letakeane/28d852307097695c5d50b15857cb28eb): Build a single-page application in Vue.js that queries the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API and displays the day's image. The application should include a way to view each of the current month's pictures, and a way to return to the current day's picture. Be creative with how you present the collections - think about the experience of the viewer with what they want to view and learn.
